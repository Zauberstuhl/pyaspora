Aim
---

To create a second implemention of the "Diaspora" social network, to create an
ecosystem around the protocol. I would like to license it under a more liberal
license than the main implementation in the hope that it increases adoption.

Status
------

THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT COMPLETE AND IS NOT YET FUNCTIONAL.

I started by doing the webfinger protocol work to interact with existing
Diaspora "pods" (nodes), but realised it would be more useful if I created a
stand-alone "social network" and then integrated it with the Diaspora protocol.

Thus, there is a Flask web site that offers basic social networking (you
can create users, befriend local users and post messages onto your wall that
your friends can view).

Quick start
-----------

./quickstart.py

Browse to:

http://localhost:5000/setup
http://localhost:5000/user/create
http://localhost:5000/user/login
http://localhost:5000/contact/1/profile

Dependencies
------------

(I'm trying to track licenses to ensure I eventually release it under
a suitable license).
