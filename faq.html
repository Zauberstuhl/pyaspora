        <h1>Questions, Answers</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>
What is Pyaspora?
            </dt>
            <dd>
Pyaspora is a "social network" website that can connect with the
<a href="https://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora</a> social network (and
software). With Pyaspora you can send and receive message with other
Diaspora network users (called the "D* network" in this page). Pyaspora
is not a clone of Diaspora and whilst it can work with Diaspora servers
("pods"), it has a different user-interface and implementation and does
not share code with Diaspora.  Pyaspora is open-source under a BSD-style
license and is written in
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.

            <dt>
Why? Isn't having two confusing?
            </dt>
            <dd>
In the same way that we use different email programs, I think the freedom
to choose a service that meets different needs is an important part of making
the D* network inclusive and accessible to all. Diaspora already offers a the
freedom to choose your own Pod, and having choice in software takes this
further.
            </dd>
            <dt>
Won't this serve to dilute development and users of Diaspora?
            </dt>
            <dd>
There is a risk that having competing products may mean fewer developers for
each, but I believe this is outweighed by the advantaged of potentially having
more people using the D* network. A social network is only really useful if
people you wish to communicate with use it, and having a larger total network
means a greater chance of someone you know using it.
            </dd>
            <dt>
So which should I use, Diaspora or Pyaspora?
            </dt>
            <dd>
<strong>For most users, Diaspora is the recommended choice</strong>. Diaspora
is more heavily used and has been more thoroughly inspected and tested. It has
a more appealing and user-friendly interface.  Using an existing Diaspora
Pod requires minimal technical knowledge.  If you are more technically
experienced, reasons you may wish to choose Pyaspora include: you do not wish
to use Affero GPL software for ideological reasons, you want a lighter-weight
client with fewer dependencies, you want an interface that does not require
JavaScript to be enabled in the end-users' browsers, or that you want to
customise a D* network client to your own needs and feel more comfortable
programming in Python.
            </dd>
            <dt>
What is Pyaspora's current development status?
            </dt>
            <dd>
You can use run it and use it to connect to the D* network, but there
are known issues, including <strong>security issues</strong> (including
a lack of CSRF protection).
            </dd>
            <dt>
Where can I get it?
            </dt>
            <dd>
The software is
<a href="https://github.com/lukeross/pyaspora">available in GitHub</a>.
There is a
<a href="https://github.com/lukeross/pyaspora/blob/master/README.txt">README.txt</a>
file which outlines how to run it.
            </dd>
            <dt>
I've found a bug or want to make a suggestion.
            </dt>
